## Overview

This project is a Challenge obtained from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) page.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS preprocessor 
- JavaScript
- jQuery library

### What I learned

On this page I learned how to make a more advanced use of javascript by making a series of conditions to correctly perform the rock-paper-scissors game, integrating counters to see the player's score and mainly using the SASS preprocessor to carry out a better implementation of the styles.

### Continued development

Something that can be implemented later is the use of a database to save the score of the players and perform a login to be able to store the score of different players.
